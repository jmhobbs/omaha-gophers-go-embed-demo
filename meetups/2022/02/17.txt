We're back! It's been a long time, but we're hoping to see you all soon.

This will be a virtual meeting on Zoom and we will have two short presentations this month.

Go Generics - A General Introduction - Bryan Rockwood
Using go:embed to ship your assets - John Hobbs

We are hoping to start meeting more this year, hopefully in person eventually. If you have a topic you'd be interested in giving a presentation, please let us know!
