Hey Gophers! It's been a while since we've been together!

Come join us for an evening of Go! Ideally we will do some lightning talks, so if you have something short you'd like to present, send it on over!

Matt Steele will be discussing how to build Go for smaller Docker images.

John Hobbs will talk about using the Periph.io project.

We will also be raffling off a GoLand license, courtesy of an excellent JetBrains sponsorship. You can't win unless you attend though!

Thanks again to Flywheel for the space, food and drinks!
