10 years of Go!

Come hang out have pizza and cake with us!

We will raffle off some swag and a license for a year of GoLand, courtesy of JetBriains!

Bryan Rockwood will be presenting "YÃ¦gi: Go Scripting Zen"
John Hobbs will be presenting "Wrapping Errors in Go 1.13"

As a reminder, this meetup is both in a new location, and on a Monday instead of Tuesday. So heads up!
