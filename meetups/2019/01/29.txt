Join us for the first meetup of 2019!

Ben Stevinson will be presenting on measuring and increasing performance of a Go applications with pprof (and other tools?)

We will also be comparing notes from the Advent of Code 2018 and looking at different solutions. It's not too late to participate, just go to https://adventofcode.com/2018 and try some problems!

Thanks again to Flywheel for the space!
